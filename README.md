### Note for pairs/soft/hard.csv
These files are ordered from smallest hand/card total to largest hand/card total (ie 2+2, ..., 10+10, A+A), which is the opposite order presented in the CSV files in the google drive.

## To Run:

### Option 1
1. Change line 66 in "Solver.java" to be the path to the test file.
2. Change line 96 in "Solver.java" to be the path/name of the output file.
3. Run "Solver.java"

### Option 2
1. Edit the program arguments to include the complete file path to the input file (ie C:\Users\...\input.csv) as the first argument
2. Edit the program arguments to include the complete file path to the output file (ie C:\Users\...\output.csv) as the second argument
3. Run "Solver.java"

NOTE: if no arguments are provided, defaults to input.csv and output.csv in src\testFiles as the input and output files
